# CS-350-Emerging-Sys-Arch-Tech-

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  - The goal of the project is to create code to run a smart thermastat using a TI board. The end goals is to develop a thermostat that sends data to a server over wifi, but the purpose of the project is to prototype low-level thermostat functionality.

What did you do particularly well?
  - What I did partiucularly well was ensure that the code I wrote was commented and readable. This ensure that others will know what is going on, where I left off, and how to easily upgrade or modify my already existing code.

Where could you improve?
  - One thing that I can improve upon is conventionality in code. There are often times that even though my code is commented, I take routes that other's might not, so it isn't conventionally normal code, but it still works.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
  - Some tools and resources that I learned to work with in this class is the manuals for boards and documentation for software. There were plenty of times where I struggled to understand exactly what was going on, but I painstakingly read through the documentation to understand what was going on. I think in the future I will be able to do this and to understand it more effectively.
  
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
  - The aforementioned ability to better understand and comprehend documentation will certainly help in other projects or course work in the future. I think that there are some core fundamentals for embedded systems that I also learned from this project that will also be transferrable to future course work.
  
How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  - I made this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable by ensure that the code I wrote served as a building ground for code in the future. Instead of just writing for this project alone, I wrote the code in such a way that it would be able to be used again in the future to write further code. Additionally, I made sure to comment my code so others (and myself) would be able to understand what is going on in the future.
